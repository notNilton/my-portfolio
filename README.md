  # Portfolio

  Welcome to my personal portfolio, a space where design meets development. This project is not just a collection of work; it's a reflection of my journey, experiences, and the passion I have for creating thoughtful and engaging web experiences.

  Built with **TypeScript** and **React**, this portfolio embodies simplicity, elegance, and functionality. Every line of code was written with care, and each element is designed to resonate with both developers and designers alike. It's more than just a technical showcase—it's an ongoing experiment in pushing the boundaries of web design while maintaining an intuitive and seamless user experience.

  ### Inspiration

  This portfolio draws significant inspiration from the minimalist principles of contemporary Japanese web design, where function drives form and elegance is found in simplicity. The work of **Keita Yamada** has been a key influence on this project.

  For me, web design goes beyond aesthetics—it's about creating an experience. This portfolio strikes a thoughtful balance between clarity and creativity, designed to engage curiosity while remaining true to its purpose. 

  ### A Living Project

  This portfolio is a living project, always growing and evolving. As I continue to learn, experiment, and create, this space will transform. It's more than a static display; it's an invitation to engage with my work and to share in the creative process.
