# Portfolio  

Welcome to my personal portfolio. Here, I showcase my work as a **developer and designer**, focusing on clean, functional, and engaging web experiences.  

## Tech Stack  

Built with **TypeScript** and **React** for a modular and scalable structure:  
- **TypeScript** ensures a reliable and maintainable codebase.  
- **React** enables a dynamic, component-based architecture.  

## Design Approach  

Inspired by **minimalist Japanese web design**, this portfolio prioritizes:  
- **Whitespace** for readability and flow.  
- **Clean typography** for an intuitive user experience.  

## Features  

- **Fully Responsive** – Optimized for all devices.  
- **Dark Mode** – Switch between light and dark themes.  
- **Interactive Elements** – Smooth animations and subtle interactions.  

## What's Next?  

I plan to add a blog to share insights, tutorials, and development experiences.
